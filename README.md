# CLI Calculator

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for use for basic arithmetic calculations

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This application requires Node.js to function.
Please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download Node for Windows, Mac or Linux.

### Installing

After installing Node.js, simply download the index.js file to a drive on your computer. Navigate to the file's parent folder and run the following command:
```
node index.js
```

### Built With

## JavaScript ES5: 
I am well-versed in JavaScript and feel it is a very easy language to understand. I chose ES5 because I feel that ES6 is still a bit new and wanted to use ES5 for readability and easy modification by other users. It is also compatible with all browsers.
## Node.js
Node.js is a great tool for CLI tools as it keeps a running instance of the program until you explicitly exit. This is also excellent for testing purposes.
